# SwarmBreaker Progression Reference

This reference captures the XP curve, torment scaling, gold economy, and drafting expectations for the SwarmBreaker prototype. These values apply to runs played through the authoritative game runtime; any tooling that simulates runs should treat them as targets rather than strict replay contracts.

## XP Curve

- Target 20–25 level-ups per run.
- Prototype curve:
  - Levels 2–10: +10 XP per level.
  - Levels 11–20: +20 XP per level.
- Total XP required to reach level 20: 2830.

## Torment Scaling

- Enemy HP, damage, density, and elite frequency scale with torment rank.
- Trigger times mirror the reference SwarmBreaker tables so higher torments reach peak difficulty faster.

## Gold Economy

- Players should afford 2–3 upgrades after their early runs.
- Gold drop tuning influences the long-term grind curve.
- Shops must be occasionally affordable without trivializing choices.

## Upgrade Drafting

- Recommended 3–4 upgrade choices per level.
- Too few choices over-index RNG; too many remove tension from buildcraft.

## Run Length

- Standard run length: 20 minutes with the boss at 20:00.
- Adjusting run length requires rebalancing XP pacing and spawn density.

## Difficulty Knobs

Primary knobs used to tune the experience:

- XP curve shape.
- Enemy HP/Damage multipliers.
- Spawn rate schedules.
- Gold drop rates and shop pricing.
- Number of draft choices per level.
